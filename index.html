                    <li>A valid bingo is any 5 cells in a single row, in a single column or diagonally from corner to corner</li>
                    <li>After someone bingos you must generate a new board.</li>

                    <li>Do not generate a new board until after a mod says to do so.</li>
                    <li>If you believe you have bingo'ed, copy the URL of your board and give it to an active mod, via whisper, to verify. Mods have the final say as to whether you have bingo'ed or not. Do not argue.</li>
                    <li>Each bingo is worth 100 points via scottybot.</li>
                    <li>Points will be given out at the end of the stream.</li>
